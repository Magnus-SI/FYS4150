# Project 1

Information of different files

- The file compile.sh can be run with bash to compile poissonsol.cpp and create poissonsol.exe.
- The file poissonsol.cpp contains the main program which solves the differential equation using the differnet algorithms
- The folder vals contains values stored from a run of the program, as well as the python program sol_check.py which is a test function to ensure that the algorithms give the same values of the discretized solution v as the LU decomposition.
- The program makeplots.py gets data from the folder vals, and plots the figures which can be seen in the report.
